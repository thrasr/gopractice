Take in length/width as command line arguments and generate a linear (no possible loops) maze.  Store/create maze in 2d array, and then write it to a file.  Bonus - use image package to create an image of the maze.
* Command line arguments, file write, image package

**twittergrab.go**
Use twitter's API to take a #hashtag and return statistics or a random tweet.  Bonus - make it a simple http server that takes the hashtag as a get/post request and outputs to a page.
